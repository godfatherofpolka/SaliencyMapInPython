Example usage:
```
$ $ python saliency.py -v input.png output.png
```

## Usage Notes
* The front end (`colorizer.py`) requires [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/argparse.html) for parsing command line arguments, [`skimage`](http://scikit-image.org/) for converting the image from RGB to LAB colour space (and back again), and [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/) for loading, displaying, and saving the image.
* The back end (`colorizationSolver.py` and `colorConversion.py`) requires [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) and [`scipy`](http://www.scipy.org/).
